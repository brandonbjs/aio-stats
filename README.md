## Summary of Project

### Project Idea:

The objective of this is to combine many useful APIs that are relevant to NFL football games and then provide all the information in one place.

### Purpose:

This app is meant to cut down the due dilligence and research time needed to make informed decisions around fantasy football and sports betting.

### Planning:

- **Front-End Development:** The front-end user interface is designed and created using Next.js React and styled using Tailwind CSS. I will uphold ES6 best practices to provide the user with an intuitive, responsive, and enjoyable website experience.
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages

### Functionality

This web app will function as a large data aggregate for many useful APIs which will help the user better inform themselves on the upcoming Sunday slate of football games. This will include things like weather information, line data, opening line data, stadium information, injury updates, and more. All of this information is readily online in multiple places but not all in one place.
